# TrafficTelligence-Advanced-Traffic-Volume-Estimation-with-Machine-Learning
## Project Overview

This project is a web-based application that estimates **traffic volume** at a given time and location using **Machine Learning**. It leverages historical traffic and environmental data (like weather, holidays, time) to make predictions. The system is built using a **Flask backend** and a trained machine learning model, providing a simple interface for users to input conditions and receive an estimated vehicle count.

---

## Problem Statement

With the rapid growth of urban areas, managing road traffic efficiently is a critical need. Predicting traffic volume accurately helps:
- City planners optimize infrastructure.
- Traffic departments manage congestion.
- Ride-sharing services improve routing.

Manual counting and fixed-schedule estimations are often inaccurate. This project uses **data-driven predictions** to solve the problem.

## Step-by-Step process of the project

### 1. Collected and Preprocessed Data
- Used a dataset with features like:
  - `holiday`, `weather`
  - `temperature`, `humidity`
  - `time`, `date`, and derived features like `hour`
- Categorical data was encoded.
- Continuous data was scaled using `StandardScaler`.

### 2. Trained a Machine Learning Model
- Selected ML algorithms (e.g., Random Forest).
- Performed train-test split.
- Trained the model and saved it using `joblib` as `model.pkl`.
- Also saved:
  - `scaler.pkl` for consistent input scaling.
  - `columns.pkl` to track one-hot encoded columns.

### 3. Built a Flask Web Application
- Created a Flask backend in `app.py`.
- Designed an HTML form (`index.html`) to accept inputs.
- Used `traffic.py` to load models and make predictions.
- Displayed the result in `result.html`.

### 4. Created Web Pages
- `index.html`: Input form
- `result.html`: Shows predicted traffic volume
- Used `static/` for background images.
